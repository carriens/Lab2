                    As we discussed yesterday, problem 3 presents a bit of a challenge.  Because it is so open-ended, how we design our graph to represent the maze can drastically change our <b>graphsearch</b> algorithm.  We should keep things simple.  I asked on piazza, like we discussed, about how to move from the given matrix to a graph and the TA said a <strong>high-level</strong> description is allowed.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph">Here</a> is the link to the wiki we were looking at.

                If we design the graph as discussed, with that gigantic sparse matrix, it becomes much more difficult to search than nessesary.  However, if each square is considered a vertex and every <i>not black</i> square adjacent to it is also a vertex, allowable steps from square to square can be <em>undirected</em> edges.  Undirected is important because if perhaps graphsearch leads us down a dead end, we should be able to traverse back and resume. Visualization here. . .
